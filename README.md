### 1. The toolkit for analysis of olympus oib file used for Fig 1I

This is underconstruction.

Briefly, olympus oib files can be converted into tiff files for images of individual visual fileds by Image J and python based macro.

The toolkit for this analysis is availavle in the link below.

### 2. The code for QC, Alignment, counting of RNA-seq for Fig 3A and Fig 4G.

The code will be available upon request. 

### 3. The code for RNA-seq analysis for Fig 3A and Fig 4G.

This is currently underconstuction. 
Basically customly modified version of the R code for RNA analysis which was originally develped by Harvard Rearch Computing Core was used for the analysis.
